# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation
Overview:
This task demonstrates the implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in a web application. 2FA is an additional layer of security that requires not only a password and username but also something that only the user has on them, i.e., a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token or a code sent to their mobile device.

Features:
Two-Factor Authentication: Adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a one-time password (OTP) generated by an authenticator app in addition to their regular credentials.
QR Code Generation: A QR code is generated for easy setup of 2FA in an authenticator app.
OTP Verification: Users are required to enter the OTP to successfully authenticate.

Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language used for the server-side logic.
Flask: Lightweight web framework for Python used to create the web application.
PyOTP: Library for generating and verifying one-time passwords compatible with Google Authenticator.
qrcode: Python library used to generate QR codes.
Bootstrap: Frontend framework used for styling the HTML templates.

This task helped me to get hands on experience in the authentication process.
